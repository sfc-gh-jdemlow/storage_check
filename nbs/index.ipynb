    "# Snowflake Storage Analysis Application\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains a modular Streamlit application that provides comprehensive analysis and forecasting for Snowflake storage usage. The application is divided into several components that handle different aspects of the analysis, such as data querying, visualization, forecasting, and recommendations. The modular approach makes the code more maintainable, readable, and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### `storage/session.py`: Snowflake Session Management\n",
    "This module contains the logic for creating and managing a Snowflake session using the Snowpark API. It handles both OAuth token-based authentication and traditional username/password-based authentication. The session creation is abstracted to allow reuse across different parts of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `storage/queries.py`: Query Execution\n",
    "This module centralizes all the SQL queries used in the application. It contains functions to run these queries and return the results as pandas DataFrames. The queries themselves are organized into functions, which accept parameters to dynamically generate the correct SQL for different analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `storage/visualization.py`: Data Visualization\n",
    "This module handles all the plotting and visualization tasks within the Streamlit app. It uses Plotly to create interactive charts, such as line charts for storage trends, pie charts for storage breakdowns, and bar charts for unused table costs. The visualizations are designed to be clear and informative, providing insights at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `storage/forecast.py`: Storage Forecasting\n",
    "This module contains the logic for generating storage forecasts using Snowflake's machine learning capabilities. The forecast generation involves creating training data, building a forecast model, and generating predictions for future storage usage. The forecast results are then returned for visualization and further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `storage/recommendations.py`: Recommendations Generation\n",
    "This module generates recommendations based on the data analysis and forecast results. It assesses factors like projected storage growth, unused tables, and overall storage usage, and provides actionable insights to help optimize storage and reduce costs. The recommendations are then displayed in the Streamlit app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `streamlit_app.py`: Main Streamlit Application\n",
    "This is the main entry point of the application. It ties together the components from the `storage/` directory to create a cohesive user interface. The application is structured to first fetch and display storage data, followed by unused tables analysis, storage forecasting, and recommendations. The session state is managed to ensure that data is only fetched or computed when necessary, reducing redundant operations and improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `all_in_one.py`: Combined Streamlit Application\n",
    "This file combines all the components into a single script for easier deployment and testing. It is useful for running the application locally or deploying it to Streamlit on Snowflake. The script imports the necessary modules and creates the Streamlit app with all the required functionality. Feel free to delete or only work off this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Fetching and Initialization:**  \n",
    "   The application initializes session state variables to store the data fetched from Snowflake. It checks if the data is already in the session state; if not, it runs the corresponding SQL queries to fetch the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Visualization:**  \n",
    "   After fetching the data, the application uses the `visualization.py` module to display various charts that show historical storage usage, daily trends, and a breakdown of storage components (active, stage, fail-safe).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unused Tables Analysis:**  \n",
    "   Users can specify criteria (e.g., days since last access, storage cost per TB) to identify unused tables. The application queries Snowflake for tables that meet these criteria and displays the results, including potential cost savings from removing or archiving these tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Storage Forecasting:**  \n",
    "   Users can generate a forecast for future storage usage by specifying the number of training days and prediction days. The forecast includes upper and lower bounds, which are visualized alongside the predicted usage. The application also provides a cost estimation based on the forecasted storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Recommendations:**  \n",
    "   Based on the analysis and forecasts, the application generates recommendations to help users optimize their Snowflake storage. These include strategies for managing growth, cleaning up unused tables, and general best practices for storage management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web interface.\n",
    "- **Plotly:** For generating interactive visualizations.\n",
    "- **Snowflake-Snowpark-Python:** For interacting with Snowflake using the Snowpark API.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install these dependencies using the provided `environment.yml` file or directly via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install streamlit plotly snowflake-snowpark-python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This application uses Snowflake’s Cortex forecast function to predict future storage usage. Ensure your Snowflake account has the necessary permissions to use this function. If you prefer, you can replace this with another forecasting method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Application Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the application locally, navigate to the project directory and use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "streamlit run streamlit_app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start a local Streamlit server and automatically open the application in your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing the Application\n",
